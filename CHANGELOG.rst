3.0.1 (5 Dec 2024)

- Fix location of `py.typed` so it is included in distributions.

3.0.0 (19 Jul 2024)
-------------------

- Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported version.

- Now strictly typed.

- Addition of :meth:`Collection.bind` and :class:`~factory.Factory` to support partial building of 
  sample objects.

2.0.1 (16 Jun 2016)
-------------------

  added to the session even though they were never requested, as a result of
  a backref on a third model.

-------------------

- Backwards incompatible change to split the concern for sample object
  identity out into :class:`chide.Set` and :class:`chide.sqlalchemy.Set`
